This is the forth entry of The CHUCK E. CHEESE Tube Archives:
so my original plan didn't work out as well as i wanted, mainly because i didn't know where to start for making the code & the game.dll, plus the errors i faced with the Retro Engine version i was using before
i decided to save that plan for another time, for now however, i have the main file ripped from sonic origins witch does have the S3&K code right inside the file itself as well as the code for sonic origins itself, all i need to do is use Ghidra to extract everything
however that raised problems of it's own, mainly due to the pc i'm using, witch is from 2013 & extremly out of date & can only run so much before it brakes down & i can not risk my pc crashing on me, especally if my hard drive get's erased because of it!
so if i'm going to make this shit work, i need a hardware upgrade, but it will be a while before that happens, so until then, i'll try to make something work, if not, well fuck it, if anyone out there is an expert on this, please help me!
More Updates Soon...
