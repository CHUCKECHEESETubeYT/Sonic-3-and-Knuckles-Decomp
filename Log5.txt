This is the fifth entry of The CHUCK E. CHEESE Tube Archives:
a dissagrement between me & a person i was working with lead to a massive argument & now we're not talking to eachother anymore, but it's fuckever, i still have the main file nessasary for the S3&K
for those who wish to know, it's a rip from the switch version of sonic origins & now all i need to do is decompress, dissasemble & finally: decompile said file & i should be good as gold
however, if i'm ever going to do such, i would need some switch tools if i'm ever going to get started, luckly, there are some tools out there already, so it'll be fine, just wish me luck for now
i'll see what i can do, as of writing this, i'm still working on decompressing the main file, so, that's what i'll be working on first, decompressing
More Updates Soon...
